Basic chat application with voting system, just to hack on!
This was used in my [Real Time Application](http://www.alejandroelinformatico.com/slideshows/en/real-time-applications/) talk as a demo.

Feel free to hack around with this code.

# Disclaimer
I did this code in a very short period of time. Don't expect it to be perfect, bulletproof, well organized or even optimized.
Don't use it as a reference, just use it to hack around and learn better ways of making your application real time.

# Requirements

* node.js
* redis

# Installation and usage

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ redis-server
```

```
$ node index.js
```

Now you can go to `/panel` to use the _master_ features.
